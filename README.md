This app, built with Kotlin, fetches data from an API and displays it in a user-friendly way using a RecyclerView.It also lets you open web content within the app using a WebView. What's cool is that it keeps updating the data from the API every 10 seconds, even when you've closed the app. So, you always get the latest info!
